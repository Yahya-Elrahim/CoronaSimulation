CoronavirusSimulator
Simulator of Covid-19 spread written in Java. This simulator simulates the spread of viruses in various scenarios, using a circle to represent a human.

Simulation
The simulation begins with one person infected on each side, and the first infected begins infecting others. From being infected, a person can go to the hospital or recover on their own. Those hospitalized have a higher chance of dying, and the hospital only has a certain capacity before no more people can enter. The simulation on the right side has a fraction of the population practicing social distancing, meaning they will stay in place.

Colors
Green - recovered
Red - infected
Pink - hospitalized 
Blue - healthy
Gray - dead
Note: Horizontal black line is the hospital capacity
Control variables
Graph scaling - Changes how the graph is scaled vertically so they fit on-screen.
Tickrate - Delay on timer 
People - Number of people per simulation.
Record rate - Graph will record data every time this number of ticks pass.
Recoverd rate - 
Number of days passed -
